Of course we are talking about Polish and Turkish. Learning new language is always hard and requires serious time, goal setting and follow through. That's why we recommend our website, where you can learn new words with pictures, and study grammar with lots of example, which will help you understand the rules of specific langauge.

Ask Ceren, cause our greatest challange was when we played with her friend who didn't speak English. Imagine, she had to translate everything I was saying, into Turkish, and her answers from Turkish to English.
